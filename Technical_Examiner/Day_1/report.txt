what i have done today:
    i setup a github repository that will contain all of the volunteering tasks
    i revised my C languagh notes
    i coded 7 tracing tests using C programming languagh
challenges:
    i hadn't had too many challenges because i'm already in a deep knoweledge about C programming
        and git and
tomorrow tasks:
    coding different tracing tests according to the specified languagh
suggestions:
    to help people understand the requirements of the volunteering tasks more easily, i'm planning to
    upload all of the volunteering code and reports in a github repo, i already made this repo and pushed
    first day data in it, the repo will be finished once i finish my volunteering
    you can check the repo in this link: https://github.com/mostafa-abokhadra/Gammal-Tech-Volunteering
