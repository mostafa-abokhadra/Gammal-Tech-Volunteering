#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printf("messi is the right wing\n"
            "neymar is the left wing\n"
            "suarez is the striker\n");
}



correct: there is no error in this code
wrong: syntax error in printf function, missing ',' between strings
wrong: missing return 0
wrong: main function should have no arguments
